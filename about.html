<p>Hello there! My parents named me Colin and that is what I still call myself to this day, unsurprisingly. I’m a third year Statistics Major in the Computational Statistics track at UC Davis. I’m exploring the field of data science and have been particularly intrigued by the applications of matrices and Markov chains. </p>
<p>I’m currently working on expanding my experience with R and Python for most of my projects, and Rust for more static language projects.</p>
<p>For future projects, I plan to work on writing generative art programs. </p>
