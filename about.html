<p>Hello there! My parents named me Colin and that is what I still call myself to this day, unsurprisingly. I’m a third year Statistics Major in the Computational Statistics track at UC Davis. I was originally majoring in Atmospheric Sciences, but a course in elementary statistics and a course in computer science have ignited my passions in the applications and intersections of the two. I’m exploring the field of data science and have been particularly intrigued by the applications of matrices and Markov chains. </p>
<p>I’m currently working on expanding my experience with R and Python for most of my projects, and Rust for low level static language projects.</p>
<p>For future projects, I plan to work on writing generative art programs and researching political economic data. </p>
<h4>Non-academic interests</h4>
<p>I play video games, run, and march cymbals in Cal-Aggie Marching Band-uh! I love spicy food and quality sushi. </p>
