<h1>Text Scraping Car Advertisments</h1>
<p> 
This markdown features my code from part 1 of homework 4 from STA141A Fall 2016, taught by Professor Debashis Paul. I will be extracting and sorting data from <a href="https://github.com/sssantos/Course-Datasets">a directory of car advertisement text files</a> into a data frame.
