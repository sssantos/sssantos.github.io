Hi! This is an example of an assignment in STA141b, taught by James Sharpnack. This is one of my favorite course assignments, since it visually demonstrates an application of matrices. 

No guarantees that this is 100% correct :p

# Assignment 2

## Part 1: Image Processing Basics

Computers use tiny dots called _pixels_ to display images. Each pixel is stored as an array of numbers that represent color intensities.

__Example.__ In an 8-bit grayscale image, each pixel is a single number. The number represents light intensity ranging from black (0) to white (255).

__Example.__ In a 24-bit RGB color image, each pixel is an array of 3 numbers. These numbers range from 0 to 255 and represent red, green, and blue intensity, respectively. For instance, `(0, 0, 255)` is <span style="color:#00F">bright blue</span> and `(255, 128, 0)` is <span style="color:#FF8000">orange</span>.

In this assignment, you'll use Python and NumPy to manipulate 24-bit RGB color images.

You can use `Image.open()` from the Python imaging library (PIL) to open an image:


```python
from PIL import Image

# Cat image from https://unsplash.com/photos/FqkBXo2Nkq0
cat_img = Image.open("cat.png")
```

Images display inline in Jupyter notebooks:


```python
cat_img
```




<a href="#">
    <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/img/output_3_0.png" alt="Post Sample Image">
</a>



In a Python terminal, you can display the image in a new window with `.show()` instead.

NumPy can convert images to arrays:


```python
import numpy as np

cat = np.array(cat_img)
```

To convert an array back to an image (for display) use the function below:


```python
def as_image(x):
    """Convert an ndarray to an Image.
    
    Args:
        x (ndarray): The array of pixels.
        
    Returns:
        Image: The Image object.
    """
    return Image.fromarray(np.uint8(x))
```

__Exercise 1.1.__ How many dimensions does the `cat` array have? What does each dimension represent?


```python
cat.shape
```




    (267, 400, 3)



The cat array has 3 dimensions. There are 267 rows of pixels, 400 columns of pixels, and (red,green,blue) intensity values.

__Exercise 1.2.__ Use `.copy()` to copy the cat array to a new variable. Swap the green and blue color channels in the copy. Display the result.


```python
copycat = cat.copy()
temp = copycat.copy()
copycat[:,:,1] = temp[:,:,2]
copycat[:,:,2] = temp[:,:,1]
copycat_img = as_image(copycat)
copycat_img
```

    <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/img/output_12_0.png" alt="Post Sample Image">
</a>

__Exercise 1.3.__ Why is `.copy()` necessary in exercise 1.2? What happens if you don't use `.copy()`?

If you don't use .copy() method, the "copy" of cat as well as the original will actually be names pointing to the same object. 

__Exercise 1.4.__ Flip the blue color channel from left to right. Display the resulting image. _Hint: see the NumPy documentation on array manipulation routines._


```python
flipcopy = np.fliplr(copycat[:,:,2])
flipcopy_img = as_image(flipcopy)
flipcopy_img
```

## Part 2: Singular Value Decomposition

__Example.__ We can use NumPy to compute the SVD for a matrix:


```python
x = np.array(
    [[0, 2, 3],
     [3, 2, 1]]
)
u, d, vt = np.linalg.svd(x)
# Here d is 2x2 because NumPy only returns the diagonal of D.
print "u is:\n", u, "\nd is:\n", d, "\nv^T is:\n", vt
```

    u is:
    [[-0.68145174 -0.73186305]
     [-0.73186305  0.68145174]] 
    d is:
    [ 4.52966162  2.54600974] 
    v^T is:
    [[-0.48471372 -0.62402665 -0.6128975 ]
     [ 0.80296442 -0.03960025 -0.59470998]
     [ 0.34684399 -0.78039897  0.52026598]]




__Exercise 2.1.__ Write the functions described below.

* A function that takes a matrix  and returns its principal component matrix and basis matrix. This function should also take the number of terms kept as an argument.

* A function that takes a principal component matrix and basis matrix and returns an approximation for the original matrix.

As usual, make sure to document your functions. Test your function on the red color channel of the cat image. What's the smallest number of terms where the cat is still recognizable as a cat?


```python
def pcomp(x,q):
    u,d,vt = np.linalg.svd(x)
    dmat = np.zeros(x.shape)
    np.fill_diagonal(dmat,d)
    v = np.transpose(vt)
    vq = v[:,:q]
    xvq = np.matmul(x,vq)
    vqt = np.transpose(vq)
    return (xvq,vqt)

def unpcomp(xvq, vqt):
    return np.matmul(xvq,vqt)

def compressed(x,q):
    xvq,vqt = pcomp(cat[:,:,0], q)
    return as_image(unpcomp(xvq,vqt))

cat_10 = compressed(cat,10)
cat_8  = compressed(cat,8)
cat_10
cat_8
```

    <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/img/output_20_0.png" alt="Post Sample Image">
</a>



 The cat is still recognizible at 8 terms.

__Exercise 2.2.__ You can check the number of bytes used by a NumPy array with the `.nbytes` attribute. How many bytes does the red color channel of the cat image use? How many bytes does the compressed version use when 10 terms are kept? What percentage of the original size is this?


```python
comp_xvq, comp_vqt = pcomp(cat[:,:,0],10)
smol_cat_nip = comp_xvq.nbytes + comp_vqt.nbytes
print "Red color channel:", cat[:,:,0].nbytes, "bytes"
print "Compressed w/ 10 terms:", smol_cat_nip, "bytes"
print "Percent of original size:", format(float(smol_cat_nip)/float(cat[:,:,0].nbytes) * 100, '.2f') ,"%"
```

    Red color channel: 106800 bytes
    Compressed w/ 10 terms: 53360 bytes
    Percent of original size: 49.96 %
